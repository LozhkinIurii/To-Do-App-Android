This simple app was made using Android Studio during university Mobile App Development course.
The app fetches random "to do" task from REST api and shows it on second screen.
First screen contains button for fetching the data, and the second screen contains buttons for going back on 1st screen and for Google Translate web page.
The app has not any fancy design, main thing is functionality.
